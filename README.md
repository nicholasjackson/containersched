## How to build - Pure Docker
Whilst having ruby installed on your dev machine can be handy there is no requirement to install this or any other dependency than Docker.  You can use the simple bash script which starts a Ruby docker container to run the build and test script, because this maps a reference to the docker sock on your local machine any commands to start docker container from within the ruby container will be proxied to your local machine, a docker server is not running inside the Ruby container.

### Build the image containing the tools
Unfortunately we need to install Docker-Compose so we can't just use the base Ruby

```bash
$ docker build -t rubydev ./_build/dockerfile/build
```

### Build a Docker image
```bash
$ ./build.sh build_image -i 192.168.99.100 # Where 192.168.99.100 is the ip address of your docker host
```

### Run the functional tests
```bash
$ ./build.sh cucumber -i 192.168.99.100 # Where 192.168.99.100 is the ip address of your docker host
```

## How to build - With Ruby installed
### Setup
```bash
$ cd _build
$ bundle
```

### Build a Docker image
```
$ rake app:build_image
```

### Run the functional tests
```
$ rake app:cucumber
```
